# Create Agent Teams

Guide the user through designing and generating a bobi agent team.
An agent team is a portable bundle — role prompts, workflows, monitors,
and tool guides — that defines a multi-agent system. The output is a
runnable `agents/<pack-name>/` directory.

## Output structure

```
agents/<pack-name>/
├── agent.md              # Human-readable team description
├── agent.yaml            # Team config (entry point, services, credentials)

│   └── <role>/
│       └── ROLE.md
├── tools/                # Service interaction guides (loaded into all roles)
│   └── <service>.md
├── workflows/            # DAG definitions for multi-step processes

    └── <template>.md
```

## How to guide the conversation

### 1. Understand the use case

Ask focused questions (2-3, not a wall):
- What problem are they solving? What does success look like?
- What events trigger work? (webhooks, messages, schedules, manual)
- What outputs should the system produce? (PRs, messages, reports, etc.)
- How many distinct roles are needed? Coordinator + workers, or peers?

### 2. Propose the design

Based on answers, propose:
- **Roles**: how many agents, what each does, their relationship
- **Workflows**: sequences of steps and routing decisions
- **Event sources**: integrations needed (github, slack, linear, etc.)
- **Monitors**: conditions worth polling for (if any)

Explain in plain language. Get agreement before writing files.

### 3. Generate the pack

Write files in this order, explaining each as you go:

1. `agent.yaml`
2. `agent.md`
3. Role prompts (`roles/<name>/ROLE.md`)
4. Tools (`tools/<service>.md`) — if the team uses external services
5. Workflows (`workflows/*.yaml`)
6. Monitors (`monitors/defaults.yaml`) — if applicable
7. Context files (`context/*.md`) — if roles share reference material
8. Workspace templates (`workspace/`) — if users must supply domain content

### 4. Finalize

Show the directory tree, explain how to run (`bobi agents install
agents/<pack-name> --name <agent>` then `bobi agent <agent> start`), and
mention that installed package files are regenerated from source.

## File format reference

### agent.yaml

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
entry_point: <starting-role>
chat: slack                       # optional: where humans talk to the team

services:
  - name: slack
    events: true
  - name: linear
    events: true

slack:
  bot_token: ${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}   # secrets are ${VAR} refs, filled from .env

linear:
  api_key: ${LINEAR_API_KEY}
```

Only include services the team actually needs. `bobi agents install`
prompts for any `${VAR}` references and writes them to `run/.env`.

To give the team host tools, skills, or MCP servers, declare them under
`tool_library:` (a named catalog entry like `- venn`, or an inline dependency
with a required `success:`). See `docs/TOOL_LIBRARY.md` for the two ways to
declare a dependency (pinned `install:` vs guide-only) and how catalog entries
let you pull a tool in by name.

### agent.md

```markdown
# Team Name

One-paragraph description of what this agent system does.

## Roles

- **role-a** — what it does
- **role-b** — what it does

## Workflows

- `workflow-name` — when it triggers and what it does

## Setup

bobi agents install agents/pack-name --name my-agent
bobi agent my-agent start
```

### Role prompts (roles/<name>/ROLE.md)

Each role is a folder with a `ROLE.md`. The folder can hold additional
resources the role needs.

Principles for role prompts:
- **Start with identity**: "You are a [role] that [does what]."
- **Define scope**: What this role does and does NOT do.
- **Be operational**: Concrete instructions, CLI commands, decision tables.
- **Include examples**: Show what good output looks like.
- **Set boundaries**: What to delegate vs handle directly.

Coordinator structure:
```markdown
# Role Title

You are a [role] for [scope]. You receive events and [what you do].

## Event handling

| Event type | Action |
|---|---|
| ... | ... |

## Operational rules

- ...
```

Worker structure:
```markdown
# Role Title

You are a [role] that [does what]. You receive tasks from [who] and
[produce what output].

## How you work

Step-by-step instructions.

## Quality standards

What "done" looks like.
```

Role prompts: 300-600 lines for complex roles, under 100 for simple workers.
Every line should be an instruction the agent will use — no filler.

### Tools (tools/<service>.md)

Service interaction guides loaded into every agent automatically.

```markdown
# Service Name

Brief description.

## Operation A

\```bash
command <args>
\```

## Key rules

- Important constraint
```

Name after the service: `github.md`, `slack.md`, `linear.md`, etc.

### Workflows (workflows/*.yaml)

```yaml
name: workflow-name
trigger: >
  When [condition]. One sentence.
description: >
  What this workflow does end-to-end.

steps:
  - name: step-name
    agent: role-name
    model: sonnet      # optional: override the team default for this prompt step
    prompt: |
      Instructions for this step.
    handoff:
      required: [field1]
      optional: [field2]
    timeout: 1800

  - name: route-step
    if: "field1 == true"
    goto: step-a
    else: step-b

  - name: wait-step
    await: event-type
    timeout: 86400
```

Step types:
- **Prompt step**: `agent` + `prompt` — agent executes and writes handoff
- **Route step**: `if` + `goto` + `else` — deterministic branch
- **Await step**: `await` — suspends until external event arrives

Runtime model selection lives in `agent.yaml` by default:

```yaml
brain:
  kind: codex          # omit the block entirely for Claude Code
  model: gpt-5-codex   # optional provider-specific model or alias
```

Workflow prompt steps can override that team default for just one step:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: discover
    agent: prospect-targeter
    model: haiku
    prompt: "Find companies matching the wedge..."
```

For Claude-backed teams, `model` can be an alias such as `haiku`, `sonnet`, or
`opus`, or a full Claude model ID. Bobi passes provider-native model strings to
the selected backend; it does not translate model names across providers.

Always include `adhoc.yaml`:
```yaml
name: adhoc
trigger: >
  For any ad-hoc task that doesn't match a more specific workflow.
description: >
  Open-ended task with no structured lifecycle.

steps:
  - name: task
    prompt: "${{input.task}}"
```

### Monitors (monitors/defaults.yaml)

```yaml
monitors:
  - name: check-name
    description: What this monitor checks
    interval: 15m
    event: monitor/check.detected
    check: function_name      # Optional: native check
```

Monitors without `check:` are executed by a short-lived agent that
evaluates the description and posts an event only if something is found.

### Context files (context/*.md)

Team-shipped reference content — rubrics, methodology, output format
specs, examples — that agents read on demand. Installed frozen to
`run/package/context/`; reinstall restores them and `bobi agent <name> doctor`
flags hand-edits. Agents see an index (path + first line) in their
prompt, so make the first line of each file a one-line description.

Use context/ instead of tools/ when the content is reference material
rather than a service guide — tools load fully into every role's
prompt; context files cost nothing until an agent reads one.

### Workspace templates (workspace/)

Seed files for user-owned domain content: the things only the user can
fill in (positioning, source lists, configuration the team researches
against) and the directories agents write work products into. Install
copies `workspace/` to `run/workspace/` — each file only if
absent, so reinstall never overwrites what the user or agents wrote.

Reference these from role prompts by their installed path
(`workspace/<file>`), and tell the user in `agent.md` which files to
fill in before starting the team.

## Built-in CLI tools

Every agent has access to the full `bobi` CLI — messaging
(`agent <name> message`, `agent <name> ask`, `slack-reply`), sub-agent
management (`agent <name> subagents launch`, `list`, `cancel`), and
observability (`agent <name> status`, `events`, `transcript`). Reference
these in role prompts so agents know how to
communicate and delegate.

See [`skills/bobi.md`](../skills/bobi.md) for the complete
command reference.

## Design principles

1. **Coordinator + workers**: Most packs have one persistent coordinator
   that receives events and dispatches workers. Workers are short-lived.

2. **Workflows encode process, not logic**: A workflow defines WHAT steps
   happen in WHAT order. The HOW lives in role prompts.

3. **Handoffs are contracts**: Required handoff fields are the API between
   steps. Design them carefully.

4. **Monitors fill webhook gaps**: Only add monitors for conditions no
   webhook covers (stale items, drift, health checks).

5. **Keep it simple**: Fewer roles and workflows to start. Users add more
   in the team source and reinstall.

## Important

- Generate a complete, working team — no placeholders or TODOs.
- Role prompts should reference `bobi` CLI commands the agent will use.
- Don't copy engineering-specific content into non-engineering packs.
- Write files to the team source directory, normally
  `$BOBI_HOME/agents/<name>/src/`.
